#Challenge: 
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

#Solution:
First define a function with 2 argument. Next you will need to declare a counter and set it's value to zero. Then create a for loop itterating through our list while incrementing the counter. You will then need to create an if statement checking if the item is equal to our second argument. If no match is found at in our list our loop will return -1.
